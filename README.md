# Disease-Diagnosis-application

I have used machine learning concepts to develop the prototype.
**Algorithm**: RANDOM FOREST Classification
**Dataset**: “**disease symptom sorting**” from Kaggle.
**Language**: R

**How to Use?**
-> Open the application
-> Select 5 predominant symptoms from a range of 132 symptoms
-> Receive instant diagnosis

**Benefits:**
In remote areas like small villages, people don’t have access to instant medical help, this could be the solution.
Can confirm your apprehensions about a disease.
